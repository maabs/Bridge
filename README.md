# Unbiased Parameter Estimation of Partially Observed Diffusions using Diffusion Bridges

This repository contains the implementation and results for the project *‚ÄúUnbiased Parameter Estimation of Partially Observed Diffusions using Diffusion Bridges‚Äù*.  

The code is organized into source files, test cases, and numerical results.

---

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **`bridge.py`**  
  Main implementation of the algorithm.

- **`PF_functions_def.py`**  
  Auxiliary functions used by the main code.

- **`Bridge_parallelization.py`**  
  Contains modified functions enabling parallel computing with the `multiprocessing` library.  
  Stores parameters for each Ibex run (each run identified by an ID).

- **`bridge_test.py`**  
  Collection of test routines covering each stage of the algorithm.

- **`test_result/Test.ipynb`**  
  Jupyter notebook displaying the numerical results presented in the paper.

- **`Kangaroo_data.txt`**  
  Observational data for the kangaroo population example.

- **`Girsanov approach matlab`**  
  Matlab code for the comparison with the Girsanov approach.

## üß™ Tests

All major algorithmic components are tested in `bridge_test.py`.  
For reproducibility, additional test cases and results are shown in `test_result/Test.ipynb`.
